Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of particles at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical mechanics fails. Unlike classical objects, particles in quantum mechanics exhibit dual wave-particle nature, meaning they display both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on the measurement. Fundamental to quantum mechanics is the concept of quantization, where properties like energy exist in discrete levels rather than continuous values. Quantum mechanics apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which we can't known the exact momentum and position at the same time. Therefore, in quantum mechanics the momentum and position in the state of probabilistic not deterministic. Even so, we still can calculate the density that give us the information of particle from its minimum to maximum probability.
